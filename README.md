Full Stack Developer | React & React Native Specialist

As a recent graduate of the Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, I have honed my skills in full-stack development, 
with a particular focus on React and React Native. My technical journey began in January 2022 as a self-taught developer, 
where I utilized resources such as Codecademy, Mimo, and Udemy to build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

At Nucamp, from January 2024 to August 2024, I completed both the Web Fundamentals and Full Stack Bootcamps. 
My training encompassed a broad range of technologies, including:

Front-End Technologies: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, React Native

Back-End Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose

Additional Skills: JSON, APIs, Bootstrap, user privacy/security

I am currently targeting a Front-End React position but am open to any role in tech that will help me gain further experience and grow my skill set.
My hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development, combined with a strong commitment to learning and problem-solving,
positions me well for a dynamic and challenging role in the tech industry.
